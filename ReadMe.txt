SEMESTER PROJECT 2:
Calculator

Implemented all required buttons on the calculator, including 4 function, equals, negate, mod, clear and CE.
Parentheses work as intended.
Order of operations is respected when equals button is pressed.

Note* I partnered with Ben Hill on this project so that's why our code is the same.
Note* We also used an engine found online to get accurate answers from the equals button, noted in Ben's ReadMe.
